# IPL Analysis Dashboard with Power BI 🏏

## 📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes IPL data from **2008 to 2024** using **Power BI**. It provides deep insights into player performance, team success, match outcomes, and more. The dashboard is designed to be fully interactive, allowing users to explore data based on **season**, **player**, **team**, and **venue**.  

The goal of this project is to enhance skills in **data modeling**, **DAX calculations**, and **interactive data visualization** using Power BI.
